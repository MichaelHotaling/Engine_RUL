# Predicting Remaining Useful Life of Machinery using Machine Learning

Remaining Useful Life, or RUL, is a metric used to define the number of cycles or timeframe machinery, systems, or
components have before maintenance should be performed. Accurately predictive RUL plays a critical role in equipment
health management, or EHM. With the dawn of IoT and Industry 4.0, it is now possible to more accurately calculate RUL
and, by doing so, only performing maintenance when appropriate, saving time, money and resources

The dataset for this project was used for the prognostic
challenge competetion at the International Conference on
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM08) [1]. The
dataset consists of several multivariate time series
observations that demonstrate the degredation several
different engines under different operating conditions,
simulated using Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion
System Simulation software (C-MAPSS). Each engine starts
with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing
variation which is unknown. The data contains sensor data
contaminated with noise for the following engine attributes.
